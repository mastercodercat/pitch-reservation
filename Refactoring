WHAT I AM WORKING ON:
user validations
cart validations

HAS BEEN DONE
Reservations --> belongs_to equipment_model, belongs_to object

when checking out, several reservations are created, same user

Equipment Model --> has_many Reservations

Initial Reservation associates with an Equipment model id

NEEDS DOING:

RESERVATIONS (avoid for now)
display reservations in groups, first by date, second by user
after checkout, associates with an Equipment object ids
Cart==> can probably stay the same, just change checkout action



VALIDATIONS
for each user,
all reservations for any given user any give day cannot contain more than one camera (avoid)

WHEN YOU CHECKOUT TWO OF THE SAME ITEM, IT SAYS SUCCESSFUL, BUT ONLY RECORDS ONE

CATALOG:

counting: can now count the number of reservations differently

Reservations view: Admin view for any old reservation should show the equipment model id


WHAT I KNOW IS WORKING
CATALOG, ADDING OBJECTS, ADDING MODELS
MAKING RESERVATION



WHAT I KNOW ISNT WORKING
CHECKOUT PROCEDURE  JAMES IS WORKING ON IT
