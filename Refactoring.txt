Current issues with newly refactored Reservations:

1. Quicksearch doesn't work. Something to do with the partial, but I don't understand why (Predates this summer)
2. Reservation index view is segmented, not grouped by patron or date (Due to refactoring)
3. Cart does not flash an error for illogical date ranges. It claims the reservation has been made, and then doesn't make it  (Predates this summer)
4. Users can put in nonsensical information for their contact info (Predates this summer)
