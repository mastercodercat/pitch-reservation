Current issues with newly refactored Reservations:

1. Users can put in nonsensical information for their contact info (Predates this summer)
2. Quicksearch doesn't work. Something to do with the partial, but I don't understand why (Predates this summer)

4. We currently prevent users from checking out past the category and equipment model limit. They are still capable of reserving past these limits. A patron could potentially make two reservations, back to back, and only checkout one at a time, and thereby hog a certain piece of equipment.



3. Reservation index view is segmented, not grouped by patron or date (Due to refactoring)
5. Fix Routing
