Current issues with newly refactored Reservations:

1. Quicksearch doesn't work. Something to do with the partial, but I don't understand why (Predates this summer)
2. Reservation index view is segmented, not grouped by patron or date (Due to refactoring)
3. Users can put in nonsensical information for their contact info (Predates this summer)
