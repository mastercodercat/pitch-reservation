Reservations
============

Reservations makes it easy to run an equipment checkout program. It can help with the following tasks:

* Allowing people to reserve equipment in advance, with an easy to use catalog interface
* Enforcing rules on who can reserve equipment, and for how long.
* Checking in/out equipment, including unique checklists for each item
* Managing large amounts of equipment, including reporting, tracking, and inventory
